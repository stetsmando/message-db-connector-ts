# Interactive Test

Some tests are difficult to execute and the cost of setting up tooling to automate them isn't worth the investment. This is a directory for those test.

## Execution of Interactive Tests

In order to execute the interactive tests you must first build the project using the `build` command.
Then you can execute the test of your choice by running `node lib/<build>/interactive-tests/<file>.js`.
